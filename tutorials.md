I am Ze Sun. I studied tryGit Tutorials including what is Git, how to use Git, how to set up Git, and how to authenticate with GitHub from Git. It was clear to follow these steps. I successfully pushed the changed files to GitHub and could use Git and GitHub to switch between local and remote updates. GitHub is a very useful tool for us and we no longer have to worry about losing the code we just wrote.

I am Rohit Kumar. I went through all of the major git lessons, including those on branching, merging, rebasing, and other topics. All of the questions were simple to answer because the directions, from beginner to advanced levels, were clear and straightforward. I quickly learned all the fundamentals of git, but if we want to examine a particular step, i must start from scratch.

I am Meet Patel. I have gone through all the git lessons and I learnt that how to create repository, fork repository, follow someone on github, ask queries and doubts using communication, git cheat sheet which includes basic github commands. We can help on someone else project using github through forking.

I am Anita Kayada.I studied all main git tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing,cherry-pick and many more. It was easy to solve all the questions as instructions were clear and concise from basic to advance levels.Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of changes.
In Git baranching 1st we can create a branch,make all the changes,then we can merge to the main branch andonce we done we can delete that branch.I learnt all the basics of git in an easy manner but if we want to check some step it will start again from beginning.

Hello, I am Jitendra Singh Shekhawat.I was assigned a trygit tutorial for the assignment and through this tutorial I learned what Git is, using Git on the command line and how to setup git on your system. Also, I got to know about how I can authenticate with GitHub from git using either HTTPS or SSH. Further, I studied how I can create repositories, make changes and manage files on github using both CLI and web browser. All the topics in the trygit tutorials were explained in a precise manner, but I feel that the other 2 tutorials were easier to understand and more interactive compared to this tutorial. 

My name is Nilesh Gupta. I learned about Git Branching and the functions of many GIT commands, such as how to create branches, how to merge and rebase, and many others. It was simple to practise and learn how the instructions actually operate in a real environment thanks to the questions that went along with each tutorial. The lesson begins at an easy level so that beginners may understand the fundamentals and gradually advances to a more difficult level. The tutorial's division into two sections, main and remote, was its strongest feature. We were able to learn more about the pull and push instructions in the remote section. We created new branch, pulled the file, made changes and subsequently merged it with the main branch. Even after working simultaneously on the same file with other ensured that no one lost their data.

Myself Abitha Jerusal Cepha Fenson. I have learned all major git lessons, including those on Branching, Merging, Rebasing, and other major topics. The questions were simple to answer even for beginners because the directions were clear and straightforward. The tutorial includes two sections Main and Remote and it is a good feature. I learned about push and pull instructions in the remote section.I created new branch, pulled the file, made changes and subsequently merged it with main branch.

I'm Jeslin Hanna Prasad. I learned how to create a Git on the command line, download and install a Git, set up a login and email address in a Git repository, and authenticate with GitHub from a Git repository thanks to the TryGit tutorials. The procedures made it easier to clone using SSH, generate SSH keys on the computer, and push or pull files from GitHub. After creating a repository, one may backup the code, and I learned how to fork a repository, which enables you to change one repository without modifying the data itself.

I am Jerry Babu.  I went through the git tutorial and learned how to set up git and ruby. I also learned to create a git repository, check the status of the repository, monitor the state of the working directory, and stage changes for later commits. I have also understood how to view the history of the project and set up aliases and shortcuts for git commands. It is very easy to go back to previous snapshots. I have also successfully done commands for undoing local and staged changes, reverting changes that have already been committed, remove the commit. I have done steps for creating and navigating branches, making changes in the master branch, merging, creating, and resolving conflicts, resetting the greet and master branch, and merging back to the master branch. The entire tutorial was easy to understand, and I could learn each step in a detailed way.

I am Sherin Kandathil Baby. I set up git and ruby after going through the git tutorial. Additionally, I have run commands to configure my name, email address, and preferred line- endings. I have also learned how to set up a git repository, verify the status of the repository, keep track of the working directory's condition, and stage changes for subsequent commits. In addition, I understood how to create aliases and shortcuts for git commands and check the project's history. It is quite simple to access earlier snapshots. I've also executed commands to undo local and staged changes, roll back changes that have already been committed, and delete commits with success. Making modifications to the master branch, and merging, creating, and traversing branches are all things I've done.

I am simmerjeet singh.I studied trygit tutorial and learned about the Git , using Git on the command line and how to setup git on your system.
I learned how to create a repository,fork a repository without changing the orignal project.We can also interact with others who are working on project and by using cheatsheet we can save our time.All topics on trygit are explain precisely.

Hi I'm Chithra , The Git immersion was a helpful tutorial that covers the basics and fundamentals of git (merge, checkout, etcâ€¦). It is easy to follow with clear instructions.
