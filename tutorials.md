I am Ze Sun. I studied tryGit Tutorials including what is Git, how to use Git, how to set up Git, and how to authenticate with GitHub from Git. It was clear to follow these steps. I successfully pushed the changed files to GitHub and could use Git and GitHub to switch between local and remote updates. GitHub is a very useful tool for us and we no longer have to worry about losing the code we just wrote.

I am Rohit Kumar. I went through all of the major git lessons, including those on branching, merging, rebasing, and other topics. All of the questions were simple to answer because the directions, from beginner to advanced levels, were clear and straightforward. I quickly learned all the fundamentals of git, but if we want to examine a particular step, i must start from scratch.

I am Meet Patel. I have gone through all the git lessons and I learnt that how to create repository, fork repository, follow someone on github, ask queries and doubts using communication, git cheat sheet which includes basic github commands. We can help on someone else project using github through forking.

I am Anita Kayada.I studied all main git tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing,cherry-pick and many more. It was easy to solve all the questions as instructions were clear and concise from basic to advance levels.Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of changes.
In Git baranching 1st we can create a branch,make all the changes,then we can merge to the main branch andonce we done we can delete that branch.I learnt all the basics of git in an easy manner but if we want to check some step it will start again from beginning.

Hello, I am Jitendra Singh Shekhawat.I was assigned a trygit tutorial for the assignment and through this tutorial I learned what Git is, using Git on the command line and how to setup git on your system. Also, I got to know about how I can authenticate with GitHub from git using either HTTPS or SSH. Further, I studied how I can create repositories, make changes and manage files on github using both CLI and web browser. All the topics in the trygit tutorials were explained in a precise manner, but I feel that the other 2 tutorials were easier to understand and more interactive compared to this tutorial. 

My name is Nilesh Gupta. I learned about Git Branching and the functions of many GIT commands, such as how to create branches, how to merge and rebase, and many others. It was simple to practise and learn how the instructions actually operate in a real environment thanks to the questions that went along with each tutorial. The lesson begins at an easy level so that beginners may understand the fundamentals and gradually advances to a more difficult level. The tutorial's division into two sections, main and remote, was its strongest feature. We were able to learn more about the pull and push instructions in the remote section. We created new branch, pulled the file, made changes and subsequently merged it with the main branch. Even after working simultaneously on the same file with other ensured that no one lost their data.

Myself Abitha Jerusal Cepha Fenson. I have learned all major git lessons, including those on Branching, Merging, Rebasing, and other major topics. The questions were simple to answer even for beginners because the directions were clear and straightforward. The tutorial includes two sections Main and Remote and it is a good feature. I learned about push and pull instructions in the remote section.I created new branch, pulled the file, made changes and subsequently merged it with main branch.

I'm Jeslin Hanna Prasad. I learned how to create a Git on the command line, download and install a Git, set up a login and email address in a Git repository, and authenticate with GitHub from a Git repository thanks to the TryGit tutorials. The procedures made it easier to clone using SSH, generate SSH keys on the computer, and push or pull files from GitHub. After creating a repository, one may backup the code, and I learned how to fork a repository, which enables you to change one repository without modifying the data itself.

I am Jerry Babu.  I went through the git tutorial and learned how to set up git and ruby. I also learned to create a git repository, check the status of the repository, monitor the state of the working directory, and stage changes for later commits. I have also understood how to view the history of the project and set up aliases and shortcuts for git commands. It is very easy to go back to previous snapshots. I have also successfully done commands for undoing local and staged changes, reverting changes that have already been committed, remove the commit. I have done steps for creating and navigating branches, making changes in the master branch, merging, creating, and resolving conflicts, resetting the greet and master branch, and merging back to the master branch. The entire tutorial was easy to understand, and I could learn each step in a detailed way.

I am Sherin Kandathil Baby. I set up git and ruby after going through the git tutorial. Additionally, I have run commands to configure my name, email address, and preferred line- endings. I have also learned how to set up a git repository, verify the status of the repository, keep track of the working directory's condition, and stage changes for subsequent commits. In addition, I understood how to create aliases and shortcuts for git commands and check the project's history. It is quite simple to access earlier snapshots. I've also executed commands to undo local and staged changes, roll back changes that have already been committed, and delete commits with success. Making modifications to the master branch, and merging, creating, and traversing branches are all things I've done.

I am simmerjeet singh.I studied trygit tutorial and learned about the Git , using Git on the command line and how to setup git on your system.
I learned how to create a repository,fork a repository without changing the orignal project.We can also interact with others who are working on project and by using cheatsheet we can save our time.All topics on trygit are explain precisely.

Hi I'm Chithra , The Git immersion was a helpful tutorial that covers the basics and fundamentals of git (merge, checkout, etc…). It is easy to follow with clear instructions.

Hi, I'm Jinalkumar, I gained knowledge of Git Branching and the capabilities of several GIT commands, including how to build branches, merge, and rebase, among many more. Thanks to the questions that accompanied each session, it was easy to practice and learn how the instructions truly function in a real context. The primary and remote components of the instructional were divided into two halves, and this was its strongest point. In the remote segment, we were able to learn more about the pull and push directions. We extracted the file from the main branch, established a separate branch, performed the necessary adjustments, and then merged it. No one's data was lost even after working concurrently on the same file with others.

I am Darshilkumar Aslaliya. I was allocated the assignment named - git immersion. After reading the git immersion, I installed git and ruby.  Additionally, I learned how to set up a git repository, verify its status, keep track of the working directory's condition, and stage changes for subsequent commits. Also, I comprehend how to browse a project's history and create aliases and shortcuts for git commands. Furthermore, I have executed commands that correctly undo local and staged changes, roll back changes that have already been committed, and erase the commit. I've merged, created, and traversed branches and changed the master branch.

I am Vismay Patel and I skimmed through all the tryGit Tutorials, which cover areas like what Git is, how to use it, how to set it up, and how to log in to GitHub using Git. It was obvious what to do next. I was able to switch between local and remote updates using Git and GitHub once I successfully pushed the modified files to GitHub. I believe GitHub to be a very helpful tool, and we are no longer worried about misplacing actually written code. I read through every one of the major git lessons, including those regarding branching, merging, rebasing, and several others.

Manish Nagabhushan here. I followed the "trygit" tutorial and discovered how to set up git on your machine, use Git on the command line, and use Git.
I discovered how to fork and create repositories without altering the original code.
Additionally,, we can collaborate with others on the project and save time by using a cheat sheet.
Every topic in Trygit is thoroughly explained.

Siddharth Naidu - 

I did the Git-Immersion exercises. Its a great start to know the basics of Git and Github and how you can start commiting, reverting and managing conflicts in changes you make.
Disadvantage - It would be nicer if there is a stepped-down level of the exercises so if there is someone with little / no knowledge of git, it would be more understandable

I am Kishan Thanki and I performed all the tryGit Tutorials, which covered Signing up for a GitHub account, Created new account username, Configured Username and Email, Cloned the repo, Created new repo with readme.md, Push changes in new repo, Forked a repo, Managed files, Watched a repo. I read and performed all the useful commands like rebase, stash and merging branches.

I am Abhishek Malpotra. In this assignment, I got familiar with cloning git repositories, creating branches and merging back to the main. Further, I went through the Learn git branching tutorial, which made me aware of the concepts of a head of a repository, modifying the source tree and more. It was an excellent hands-on tutorial about the ideas and code for branching. It could have been better for beginners as I had to do more research to understand the terms better.
