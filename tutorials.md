According to my last name i am done github branching and my review for this tuorial are following

1.Interactive- As per my perception this tutorial seems interactive because It can lure people to join this  tutorial. As this tutorial involves different levels such as introduction sequence which give the knowledge about git commit command and the second level Ramping up, give us knowledge about the next serving of 100% git awesomeness etc. Hence, it is the constitution of numerous level which provide knowledge about different aspects. 
2.Instructions- This tutorial is easy to learn because it divided into few steps. Each step provides information about different aspects in easy ways. 
3.Visualization- As this tutorial involves numerous pictures or graphics therefore, we can say good example of visualization. 
4.Level- It includes two main levels and four sub levels. Moreover, Git hub is free source so anybody can use this tool according to requirement.
However, this tutorial is a good way to learn new things but in case of lengthy coding like in mix bag if user forget any step in this tutorial, then the users must have to review whole tutorial again.
