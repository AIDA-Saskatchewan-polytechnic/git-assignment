I am Ze Sun. I studied tryGit Tutorials including what is Git, how to use Git, how to set up Git, and how to authenticate with GitHub from Git. It was clear to follow these steps. I successfully pushed the changed files to GitHub and could use Git and GitHub to switch between local and remote updates. GitHub is a very useful tool for us and we no longer have to worry about losing the code we just wrote.

I am Rohit Kumar. I went through all of the major git lessons, including those on branching, merging, rebasing, and other topics. All of the questions were simple to answer because the directions, from beginner to advanced levels, were clear and straightforward. I quickly learned all the fundamentals of git, but if we want to examine a particular step, i must start from scratch.
