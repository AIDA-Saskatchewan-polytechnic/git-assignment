I am Kamalvir Kaur.I studied all main git tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing and many more. 
It was easy to solve all the questions as instructions were clear and concise from basic to advance levels.
 I learnt all the basics of git in an easy manner but if we want to check some step it will start again from beginning.

I am Ze Sun. I studied tryGit Tutorials including what is Git, how to use Git, how to set up Git, and how to authenticate with GitHub from Git. 
It was clear to follow these steps. I successfully pushed the changed files to GitHub and could use Git and GitHub to switch between local and remote updates. 
GitHub is a very useful tool for us and we no longer have to worry about losing the code we just wrote.
