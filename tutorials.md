I am Jitendra Singh Shekhawat 
I was assigned a trygit tutorial for the assignment and through this tutorial I learned what Git is, using Git on the command line and how to setup git on your system. Also, I got to know about how I can authenticate with GitHub from git using either HTTPS or SSH. Further, I studied how I can create repositories, make changes and manage files on github using both CLI and web browser. 
 
All the topics in the trygit tutorials were explained in a precise manner, but I feel that the other 2 tutorials were easier to understand and more interactive compared to this tutorial.
